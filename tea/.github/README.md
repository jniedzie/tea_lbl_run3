`tea` (toolkit for efficient analysis) is a set of tools developed at DESY for analysis of any ROOT trees. 

It is designed for speed (CPU-intensive operations implemented in C++), based on intuitive loop-based logic, while hidding most of the tricky and tedious operations behind a user-friendly API and using Python for configuration and lightweight operations.
